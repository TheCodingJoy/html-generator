# HTML5 Template Page Generator

**Latest release:**  v1.0.0 (TheCodingJoy), June 17th, 2019

Check the live version [here](https://thecodingjoy.github.io/html-generator/).


## Description

Due to the lack of proper HTML5 template generators online, except for [HTML5Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) which is what most people use, I decided to create my own tool for generating **modular, responsive and customizable** templates, based on my needs. After tinkering around for a while, this tool came to be, allowing me and hopefully others to create their own webpage templates, following the HTML5 standard.

## Features

- **HTML5 compliance**: As the name suggests, the *HTML5 Template Generator* has been built based on the HTML5 specification!
- **Popular libraries support**: Choose from some of the most popular libraries to include in your template, like jQuery, Bootstrap and AngularJS!
- **Handcrafted templates for your needs**: The *HTML5 Template Generator* offers a wide variety of templates that you can use to start your project, from simple pages, content showcases to test your resources, commonly used forms and error pages!
- **Customizable templates**: All templates generated are customizable. This means that you can change most of their parameters, styling and resources, as well as metadata. Tweak them to suit your needs as best as possible!
- **Export to Codepen or JSFiddle**: After your template is done, you might want to tweak a few things or get working on it instantly online. Just hit the <kbd>Edit in Codepen</kbd> or <kbd>Edit in JSFIddle</kbd> buttons and get going!

## How to use

Go to the [live version](https://thecodingjoy.github.io/html-generator/) and customize your template. When you're all done, use the **Result** tab to get your template and start using it.

**Note**: If you want more extensive information about how to use this tool, try the **Help & Info** tab in the live version.
